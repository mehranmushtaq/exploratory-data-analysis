## 📊 COVID-19 Data Visualization

Country-wise COVID-19 data analysis and visualization using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
This project explores trends in **confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, active cases**, and compares them across **WHO regions**.



## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on COVID-19 data and present meaningful insights through clear and informative visualizations.

The notebook analyzes:
- Spread of COVID-19 across countries
- Recovery and death trends
- Region-wise comparisons using WHO classifications



## Visualizations Included

- **Confirmed vs Deaths (Scatter Plot)**  
  Bubble size represents *Active cases*, colored by WHO region.

- **Recovered vs Confirmed**  
  Shows recovery patterns across regions.

- **Top 10 Countries by Death Percentage**  
  Bar chart highlighting countries with the highest death rates.

- **Average Recovery Percentage by WHO Region**  
  Region-wise comparison of recovery efficiency.

- **Country-wise Bar & Scatter Plots**  
  Comparative analysis of confirmed, recovered, deaths, and percentages.
